## V0.1 Release goals

- Data quality checks only
- CSV only
- Overview of inferred types and missing values
- Option to coerce to new types, and return problem values

TBC on whether to include some kind of visual representation of these - eg. null distribution. The priority for now is to get some working functions, then consider optimal OO layout.
